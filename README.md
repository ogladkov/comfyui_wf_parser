# COMFYUI WORKFLOW2API PARSER

### Description
This is a small tool which performs conversion from *.json files with ComfyUI workflows to ComfyUI's API format. 
When I started to work with ComfyUI API it was necessary to extract different data from its workflow files manually. Now it does the parser.


### How to use
You only need to feed the Parser with ComfyUI's workflow file and it will return the ready JSON.
